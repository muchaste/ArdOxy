## Background
Oxygen is a limited but essential resource for aquatic life. In many ecosystems, dissolved oxygen fluctuates and can reach critically low concentrations - a condition called hypoxia. Fish that have evolved under the pressure of aquatic hypoxia have developed many adaptations, ranging from behavioral strategies and morphology (-> gills!) to biochemical and physiological adjustments. These adaptations secure their survival under hypoxic conditions.

A simple way to reproduce hypoxic conditions is to bubble nitrogen gas into water. The nitrogen displaces dissolved oxygen but remains otherwise inert - it does not react with the water. Hypoxic conditions, however, need to be monitored and controlled as fish need oxygen for their survival. Thus, periodic measurements and adjustments of oxygen levels are mandatory to create safe and reproducible conditions.

This project aims to create the basis for an open and reproducible oxygen control system on which interested researchers and afficionados can improve and develop their own systems. It aims to fulfill the following requirements:
* long-term measurement and logging of dissolved oxygen and temperature
* reproducible control of dissolved oxygen via nitrogen influx
* open and reproducible design
* affordability
